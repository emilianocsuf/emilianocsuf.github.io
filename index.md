### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 part 1 was a favorite because we created an animated gradient image. I was able to write functions that would create a moving image of colors. The most enjoyment I got from this lab was seeing the finished product as I found it mesmerizing.

* Lab 8
    
    Lab 8 part three was another favorite of mine because we got to work with files. We created a file where we would be able to write and save a message on the file. Overall I enjoyed completing this lab as it gave me the knowledge on how files work which will help me when I create bigger coding projects.

* Lab 3
    
    Lab 3 part 3 was another favorite of mine because this was part of the lab that I completed on my own for the first time. This lab required us to make a hilo game with if and else statements. Overall, coding this lab on my own is the reason why itâ€™s one of my favorites as that sheer excitement I got when it was completed, made me realize this is the major I belong to.
